              Services) and for individuals, corporates, groups or families (Users) to book and pay for these services.
              Any agreement for the Host Services is between the Host and User only. We do not offer any services,
              including any Host Services, apart from the use of the site. Our service to you is the provision of access
              to the Site, any related customer support in relation to the Site, and to facilitate the booking and
              payment of Host Services only. Users and Hosts acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for
              providing the Host Services.</p>
            <p>4.2 Hosts are required to register with the Site in order to utilise our services. These Terms of Use shall apply to Hosts and a separate set of terms of use apply to Users.</p>

          <li>
            <h3>8. Booking Host Services</h3>
            <p>8.1 Once Host Services have been posted, the applicable Host will receive notification once a User requests such Host Services. We will notify the User on screen and/or by push notification via text or email (provided that a valid email address is supplied) confirming the booking request for the Host Services. This represents a confirmation that the Host Services have been booked (a Booking Confirmation).</p>
            <p>8.2 At the point a User receives the Booking Confirmation, payment will be taken from the User.</p>
            

          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>9. Prices and Payment</h3>
            <p>9.1 We may change the user payment methods that we accept at our sole discretion at any time without notice.</p>
            <p>9.2 Host Services may be made available at either standard or discounted rates, as specified on the Site, when listing a Host Service, provided that the rates specified in clauses 9.2.1 and 9.2.2 are not inconsistent with the fibodo payment administration guidelines set out at Schedule 1 and/or the Site:</p>
            <p>9.2.1 Package Rates : Package bookings may be discounted as set out on the Site when listing the Host Services(s). Package rates will only be offered where expressly selected when listing a Host Service. For example, if a package of Host Services is offered then rates may be expressed as "X for the price of Y"(e.g. "4 for 3") meaning that the package is priced below the cost of X number of Host Services if booked individually.</p>
            <p>9.2.2 Discounted services : Discounted rates will only be offered where expressly selected when listing the Host Services. For example, discounted rates may be offered where a User books a Host Service at short notice prior to the relevant Host Service. Host Services may be discounted as set out on the Site when listing the Host Service.</p>
            <p>9.2.3 Standard : Standard rates will apply where Package or Discounted rates are not expressly listed.</p>
            <p>9.3 If a booking is made directly with a User (Direct booking), the Host must clearly inform the user that the booking is made outside of the remit of fibodo and that all requests for refunds or other administration must be handled directly by the Host.</p>
            <p>9.4 Prices stated on our Site shall be inclusive of our commission which, for the avoidance of doubt, is deemed to be paid by the Host to us and not by the User to us.</p>
            <p>9.5 Hosts agrees not to market Host Services, or any services substantially similar to the Host Services, on any third party booking management platform other than fibodo.</p>
            <p>9.6 Hosts may agree to accept introductions of new Users from booking hub partners operating on the Site. In this case, Hosts understand that fibodo will share the spare availability of sessions within its âBooking Hub' network of partners. Bookings made through these channels will be subject to increased commissions, according to the commissions set by each Booking Hub partner, and it is the Host's responsibility when creating its products to clearly identify the level of commission amounts (identified by a sliding scale) which the Host is prepared to accept for Booking Hub partner introductions. Prices stated on our Site shall be inclusive of the booking hub partner commissions which, for the avoidance of doubt, are deemed to be paid by the Host to us and not by the User to us.</p>
            <p>9.7 Host agrees that it shall comply with the fibodo special offer guidelines set out a Schedule 1 and agrees that it shall not offer any special offers, discounted rates, loyalty programmes or any other form of reduced or preferential pricing to Users that is inconsistent with that Schedule.</p>
            <p>9.8 Hosts agree to the following payment terms (further details are set out in Schedule 1):</p>
            <p>9.8.1 Hosts agree that we will receive payment for Host Services from the User on a host's behalf and that we will subtract our commission/our affiliate commission and any third party payment service provider fees from such fees before forwarding payment to the Host within seven (7) working days of the Host services having been completed satisfactorily.</p>
            <p>9.8.2 Hosts agree that receipt by us of the correct payment from a User shall fully discharge that User's payment obligation to a Host in respect of the applicable Host Service.</p>
            <p>9.8.3 In the case of Package Rates, we will forward the single payment made to us by Users (less our commission / our affiliate commission and any third party payment provider fees) to Hosts within seven (7) working days of the first Host Service having been completed satisfactorily and Hosts agree that fibodo has no responsibility for any dispute which might arise between the Host and the User subsequently.</p>
            <p>9.8.4 Payment may be refunded to Users pursuant to Clause 10 below.</p>
            <p>9.8.5 We reserve the right (in our sole discretion) not to make payment to Hosts where a User has made a legitimate complaint in relation to the quality of the Host Services or the Host.</p>
            <p>9.8.6 Use of the Site to list and/or contract for Host Services is subject to our commission / our affiliate commission, which we may change at our sole discretion. All our fees are quoted exclusive of any applicable taxes, duties or charges.</p>
            
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>10. Cancellations, Refunds and Chargebacks</h3>
            <p>10.1 Hosts acknowledge and agree that when accepting a booking made by a User on the Site (or other arrangement between Host and User using the Site) by sending a booking confirmation, then a legally binding contract is formed between the parties.</p>
            <p>10.2 Hosts accept that Users are entitled to cancel any Host Services booked using the Site in accordance with the "Terms of Use - Users" as listed on fibodo's website (see Schedule 1 for further details).</p>
            <p>10.3 Hosts accept that if the Host cancels or is unable to provide any Host Services which have been booked, and it is not due to the fault of the User, the Host will be responsible for arranging an alternate booking or voucher or refunding the User the full amount of the fees paid by the User for the Host Services including the value of our commission, and in such event we shall be entitled to retain our commission. In the event that the Host cancels or is unable to provide Host Services part way through a class or activity package, User shall be entitled to a pro rata refund in respect of the classes and/or activities paid for by User but not yet received.</p>
            <p>10.4 Hosts agree that fibodo is not responsible or liable for:</p>
            <p>(a) any payment owed to a Host by any User, including any reclaiming of funds by a payment services provider or financial institution which may occur;</p>
            <p>(b) any fees payable in respect of the method of payment used to pay for any Host Services;</p>
            <p>(c) any failure of the Site to list your Host Services or return your Host Services in a search which is beyond our reasonable control;</p>
            <p>(d) payment of any taxes (including VAT) in connection with the Host Services; or</p>
            <p>(e) any damage to or loss of any equipment used as part of the Host Services.</p>
            <p>10.5 If the user transpires not to be the authorised user of the payment card used or if the User otherwise contests the transaction as fraudulent, the amount of a transaction may be reversed or charged back (Chargebacks). For any transaction that results in a chargeback, fibodo may withhold the Chargeback amount in a reserve or may recoup from the Host the amount of the Chargeback together with any associated fees, fines and a fibodo service charge of up to Â£20.00. If you have pending Chargebacks, we may delay payments and if we reasonably believe that a Chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold the amount of the potential Chargeback from payments otherwise due to you until such time as: (a) the Chargeback is assessed due to a User complaint, in which case we will retain the funds; (b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which the User may dispute the transaction has expired; or (c) we determine that a Chargeback on the transaction will not occur. If we are unable to recover funds related to a Chargeback for which you are liable, you agree to pay us the full amount of the Chargeback immediately upon demand. You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including lawyers' fees and other legal expenses, incurred by us for the collection of all amounts unpaid by you.</p>
            <p>10.6 If we believe you might incur, or you are incurring, an excessive amount of Chargebacks, we may establish additional conditions governing your account, including (a) establishing new processing fees, (b) creating a reserve in an amount reasonably determined by us to cover anticipated Chargebacks and related fees, (c) delaying pay-outs, or (d) terminating or suspending your use of the Site.</p>
            <p>10.7 Hosts agree to assist us when requested, at your expense, with investigations into any of your transactions processed through the Site. To that end, you permit us to share information about a Chargeback with the User, the User's financial institution, and your financial institution in order to investigate and/or mediate a Chargeback. We will request necessary information from you to contest the Chargeback. If the Chargeback is contested successfully, we will release corresponding reserved funds to your account. If a Chargeback dispute is not resolved in your favour by the network or issuing bank or you choose not to contest the Chargeback, we may recover the Chargeback amount and any associated fees as described in these terms. You acknowledge that your failure to assist us in a timely manner when investigating a transaction, including providing necessary documentation within fifteen (15) days our request, may result in an irreversible Chargeback. We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for mediating and/or investigating Chargeback disputes.</p>

            <p>Hosts agree to not:</p>

            <p>11.4 Hosts agree that we shall be entitled at any time to set-off any liability a Host owes to us against any liability that we owe to that Host, and that we may retain and apply any funds that we receive on that Host's behalf from a User against any liability which that Host owes to us.</p>
            <p>11.5 Hosts agree not to arrange to provide services to any person that the Host is introduced to using the Site by any means other than the Site.</p>
            <p>11.6 Hosts agree not to avoid or try to avoid paying us our fee in respect of any services which a Host provides to any person that the Host is introduced to using the Site.</p>
